# Using TDD, XUnit and Entity Framework. 
## Intro. 
Simple console app that serves as a basic calculator developed from acceptance tests and using TDD. This is my first stab at test driven development, a fun experience and I hope to be able to continue working this way in the future. The inital development phase may take more time using TDD, but I feel it probably can be worth it since it should result in better code quality and a project that is more understandable and maintainable.  

## Techstack & tools
+ .NET 6.0
+ Entity Framework
+ XUnit
+ Rider
+ Docker for running SQL Server on mac os
+ Datagrip

## Acceptance Tests.

### Test 1: Perform an addition.
+ Open the application
+ Choose the operation: Addition
+ Enter the first number, e.g. "5"
+ Enter the second number, e.g. "7"
+ Press Enter
+ Check that the result is displayed as "12". 

Expected result: The application presents the result "12" after the user has entered the numbers "5" and "7" and selected the operation of addition.  

### Test 2: Perform a subtraction.
+ Open the application
+ Choose the operation: Subtraction
+ Enter the first number, e.g. "5"
+ Enter the second number, e.g. "7"
+ Press Enter
+ Check that the result is displayed as "-2". 

Expected result: The application presents the result "-2" after the user has entered the numbers "5" and "7" and selected the operation of subtraction.

### Test 3: Perform a multiplication.
+ Open the application
+ Choose the operation: Multiplication
+ Enter the first number, e.g. "5"
+ Enter the second number, e.g. "7"
+ Press Enter
+ Check that the result is displayed as "35". 

Expected result: The application presents the result "35" after the user has entered the numbers "5" and "7" and selected the operation of multiplication.
